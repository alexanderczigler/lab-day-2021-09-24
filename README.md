## Introduction

A gentle comparison of GraphQL, gRPC and OpenAPI.

### What do I want to compare?
 - Basic CRUD operations
 - Way of working
 - Readability and maintainability
 - Websockets

### Method

Using each of the frameworks, build a basic API doing the same things.

## GraphQL

### Likes
 - Built-in query tool
 - Structured way to specify what is visible to the clients
 - It takes little effort to comment and document the API
 - Tooling
 - Docs + examples

### Dislikes
 - Need to learn a new query language
 - Some error messages are too esoteric/non-descriptive
 - Feels a bit repetitive
